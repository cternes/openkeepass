/**
 * A KeePassDatabase is the central API class to read and write a KeePass
 * database file.
 * <p>
 * Currently the following KeePass files are supported:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>KeePass Database V2 with password</li>
 * <li>KeePass Database V2 with keyfile</li>
 * <li>KeePass Database V2 with combined password and keyfile</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * A typical read use-case should use the following idiom:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // open database
 * KeePassFile database = KeePassDatabase.getInstance("keePassDatabasePath").openDatabase("secret");
 *
 * // get password entries
 * List&lt;Entry&gt; entries = database.getEntries();
 * ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the database could not be opened an exception of type
 * <tt>KeePassDatabaseUnreadable</tt> will be thrown.
 * <p>
 * A typical write use-case should use the following idiom:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // build an entry
 * Entry entryOne = new EntryBuilder("First entry").username("Carl").password("secret").build();
 *
 * // build more entries or groups as you like
 * ...
 *
 * // build KeePass model
 * KeePassFile keePassFile = new KeePassFileBuilder("testDB").addTopEntries(entryOne).build();
 *
 * // write KeePass database file
 * KeePassDatabase.write(keePassFile, "secret", new FileOutputStream("keePassDatabasePath"));
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see KeePassFile
